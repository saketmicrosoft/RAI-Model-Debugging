# RAI-Model-Debugging
Demos for Model Debugging and Interpretability
The demo is based on Microsoft Spark ML library. More details on that here https://microsoft.github.io/SynapseML/

The idea behind this library is to enable the customers to do model debugging on multi node spark clusters. The library works well on both DATABRICKS and SYNAPSE ML.
